## MK Awesome SVG Icons 

I have made a webpage consisting svg icons and some information about each icon.
The wonderful logo Mk is the logo for my icon webpage which means my name”Madhur Kakkar”.
There are 10 svg icons which are made by me using illustrator. These icons have animated effect. 

The webpage has been created using index.html, main.css, and JavaScript.
I have tried my best to show my idea of animation through my webpage.
